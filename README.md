# Implementing-Systolic-Arrays-for-Efficient-CNN
The Systolic Array for Efficient CNN Project focuses on optimizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using systolic array architecture to enhance performance and efficiency. By implementing distributed arithmetic, the project achieves a significant increase in processing speed and resource utilization during convolution operations. The design reached a maximum frequency of 755.715 MHz with the optimized Distributed Arithmetic (DA) MAC, compared to 452.407 MHz for the conventional MAC unit. This project showcases skills in digital design, hardware optimization, and deep learning, contributing to the development of faster and more efficient neural network architectures suitable for real-time applications.
